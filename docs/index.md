# Elegy

_Elegy is a Neural Networks framework based on Jax and Haiku._ 

Elegy can be seen as an opinionated Keras port since it keeps most of the API and documentation, but makes changes to either play better with Jax/Haiku or give more flexibility to researchers and developers, see [Differences with Keras](https://poets-ai.github.io/elegy/differences-with-keras).

#### Main Features

* **Familiar**: Elegy should feel very familiar to Keras users.
* **Flexible**: Elegy improves upon the basic Keras API by letting users optionally take more control over the definition of losses and metrics.
* **Easy-to-use**: Elegy maintains all the simplicity and ease of use that Keras brings with it.
* **Compatible**: Elegy strives to be compatible with the rest of the Jax and Haiku ecosystem.
